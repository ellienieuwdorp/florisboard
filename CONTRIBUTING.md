# Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to FlorisBoard. This document provides some
general guidelines for each type of contribution.

## Adding a new feature or making large changes

If you intend to add a new feature or to make large changes, please discuss this
first through a proposal on GitHub. Discussing your idea enables both you and me
that we are on the same page before you start on working on your change. This
also makes it more likely that your PR gets accepted.

## Adding a new keyboard layout / dictionary for locale

As FlorisBoard is currently in alpha stage, things might change drastically. This
also includes the config scheme of keyboard layouts. To prevent incompatible
configs because some features and structures may change, please do not add this
kind of content yet. As FlorisBoard's state progresses and its core stabilizes,
you will be able to add keyboard layouts.

## Bug reporting

This kind of contribution is the most important, as it tells where FlorisBoard
has flaws and thus should be imroved to maximize stability and user experience.
To make this process as smooth as possible, please use the premade [issue
template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) for bug reporting. If you
submit an bug report which does not follow the template your issue will be
marked as invalid and be closed.
